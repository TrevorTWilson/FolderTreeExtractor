Used when starting a new pipeline project as a chief welding inspector.  Makes quick work of making a new directory tree with all the needed subfolders.

Simply identify the source (root) directory you want to emulate.  Then choose the new destination folder name (root).
The new directory tree is created in seconds, and is ready to be populated with the new project documentation.
